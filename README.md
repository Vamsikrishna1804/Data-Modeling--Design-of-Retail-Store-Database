# Data-Modeling--Design-of-Retail-Store-Database

As the Retail industry is evolving largely in every nook and corner of the world, there exists an importance of customer data, supplier data, supply chain data, orders data, etc. Maintaining transaction data, invoices on paper which is written cannot be stored for longer time and maintaining higher number customers data is impossible. To make this automated and hassle free to organize and utilize the data, we have designed this retail point of sale database.  

In this project, we have designed to maintain customers data, Invoice data of the customers, supplierâ€™s data, products data, product category data and vendors data. Vendor is a person who operates point-of-sale teller machine and generates invoices as per the customer purchased products.  From this database, we can collect the data of the customers and the products purchased by them. As data plays major role in finding the patterns and in development of the business, this project will be helpful for all the retail companies to perform Analysis. This project will also lessen the human resources cost to companies and maintains the data accurately which is not possible with human beings.  

This data can be accessed only by the authorized persons, and it can also store the past and present data which would be useful for comparison analysis. This method can also have data backup facilities during the times of data losses or breaches. 

ERD diagram and Data Dictionaries are mentioned in the Final Project report with the queries and records are shown for each business case.
